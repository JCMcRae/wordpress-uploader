Lightweight Code for Wordpress Image Uploading

The code in these files are some of the lines used in CYSTech `PLNR`, the proprietary content upload and management tool I built to schedule and automate content for the Clean Your Shoes blog (on WordPress) and Instagram.

Currently, the tool is built to only support the uploading of images (`application/octet-stream`), but you can use this code to upload other forms of media as well.
